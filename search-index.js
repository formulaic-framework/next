Formulaic libraries are built to work independently of one another, yet integrate nicely if you use multiple components together. Formulaic contains modules and components that Flyyn has built into many Nest and React applications, and have been abstracted into this namespace to be reusable. Utilities return strongly-typed, safe, and chainable responses (using FP) An Either-like structure strongly types error cases A Promise-like chaining structure to quickly transform data Returned data can be directly sent to clients (using fp-interceptor) Data Types (FP) Provides a strongly-typed and chainable structure for return values. Used by most Formulaic libraries. Entity Service Provides TypeORM based utilities that are useful in most Nest services that interact with a TypeORM Repository. Hashing Module Extremely basic wrapper around bcrypt to use as a Nest service. ID Generator Module Provides powerful shortcuts to generate random, collision resistent IDs in multiple formats. FP Interceptor Intercepts outgoing HTTP responses in Nest, allowing routes to safely return FP formatted objects. Authorization (ACL) Utilities Utilities to quickly create authorization schemes using CASL. Auth Module Provides both a simple authentication guard that implements the functionality of Nest’s authentication tutorial, as well as hooks for more complex ACL schemes. Works well with the ACL library. Requires requests to authenticate via JWT, provided as an Authorization header. We recommend using Formulaic in a Yarn (version 2+, \"Berry\") monolithic repository, with a standard Nest server and a React application created with Vite. Example repository initialization mkdir ~/Documents/my-app/ cd ~/Documents/my-app/ git init --initial-branch=main yarn init -w -2 cd packages/ # Create a Nest server - this example uses the Nest CLI to initialize # the package with a basic Nest boilerplate. npx @nestjs/cli new \"my-server\" cd my-server rm -rf .git yarn add @nestjs/swagger @nestjs/typeorm typeorm express yarn add --dev webpack # Create a React application using Vite cd ../ yarn create vite --template react-ts my-app Formulaic is composed of a number of independent packages, all available on NPM under the @formulaic namespace. You can install each package individually, or you can install a meta-package that includes all of the Formulaic packages.

These implementations are organized into a basic hierarchy to help you narrow down which implementation is most suited for your use case. FP Inheritance Tree FP Data DataFP Literal BaseErrorFP ErrorFP UnexpectedError DatabaseException NoValue Empty MissingPermission NotFound AccessForbidden EntityNotFound There are two main interfaces commonly used for representing \"successful data\" - DataFP and Literal. Literal has been used extensively in the documentation so far, and is designed to be a very simple wrapper around values of any type. Basic example of Literal import { Literal } from \"@formulaic/fp\"; const input = new Literal(10); // => Literal expect(input.data).toBe(10); Literal allows you to create an FP object without defining any classes or potential for conflicting fields, however it means all data is a layer below inside the data property. DataFP is an abstract class that is ready for you to define your own FP object, representing a successful state. The next section will walk through extending DataFP in depth. By extending DataFP, details are available at the top level, and can also be included in OpenAPI documents. Example usage of custom class extending DataFP const response = new LoginResponse(\"admin\", \"[jwt contents]\"); (1) expect(response.id).toBe(\"admin\"); 1 LoginResponse extends DataFP, and is defined in the next section. FP contains a few ways to represent \"errors\"[1] or other failures. We mention UnexpectedError first, which may be the only error implementation you wish to use if you are concerned about revealing information in the case of failures. Interface of UnexpectedError class UnexpectedError extends ErrorFP { kind: \"UnexpectedError\"; status: 500; code?: string; error?: Err; serializedError?: string; } If you use fp-interceptor, UnexpectedError defaults to only returning kind and status in production environments, while also including code and error in development. This allows you to safely create instances and sub-classes of UnexpectedError without any risk of revealing error causes or information in production, which may reveal sensitive information. If you wish to create your own errors (that aren’t set to hide all properties by default), ErrorFP is made to be extended. ErrorFP extends Error with only one change - ErrorFP sets noValue to true, which prevents substitutions from running. This is very often the desired behavior, however in some cases may have something that \"failed\" yet still should be treated as a missing value. For these cases you can extend Error instead of ErrorFP, and the same instructions will hold. FP defines an explicit \"empty\" or \"missing value\" type, which both avoids the dangers of \"null\" and enables chaining and other utility functions. FP provides three ways to create \"no value\" responses. Earlier sections have already used the Empty class as a counterpart to Literal in order to create Either-like functionality. Empty is often used as-is to create a null-like \"valueless-value\", or can be extended. Along with the minimal Empty class, FP also includes built-in implementations like MissingPermission. NoValue can be directly extended for your own purposes. Frequently applications need to handle requests for entities that users do not have permission to view. While a permission denied request could be sent as a 401 Unauthorized response, it is often good practice to respond with a 404 Not Found response, completely obscuring all information about the entity including it’s existence. However, during development and debugging, there normally is no reason why developers should be restricted from seeing the root cause of an error. FP provides a built-in type to handle this specific case due to how often it comes up, even in other FP modules like our database utilities. NotFound is a base class like UnexpectedError, where all information is stripped by default in production. NotFound can be used directly, taking a description of the entity, and a flag permissionError which is set to true if an entity exists but the user can’t access it, and set to false if the entity does not exist. const notFound = new NotFound(\"User\", false); const notPermitted = new NotFound(\"User\", true); A shortcut, AccessForbidden exists for permission errors: const forbidden = new AccessForbidden(\"User\"); And implementations like EntityNotFound exist for failed operations, and may include additional information (like the failed query): import { Literal, EntityNotFound } from \"@formulaic/fp\"; import { Repository, FindOneOptions } from \"typeorm\"; async function findById( repo: Repository, id: string, ): Promise | EntityNotFound> { const query: FindOneOptions = { where: { id }, }; const found = await repo.findOne(query); if(!found) { return new EntityNotFound(\"User\", query); } return new Literal(found); } 1.

These two classes provide an implementation of Either, seen in Haskell, and JavaScript libraries such as fp-ts, Folktale, and more. Implementations of Either provide a clear and unmistakable difference between the presence and absence of data - avoiding null, undefined, and other troublesome ways of representing a lack of data. Before getting too far, it may be best to look at the actual properties of Literal and Empty - the type system will save you from the properties on the backend, but it may be helpful to see how FP works, and how the objects look after the compiler strips out type information. The following definitions include properties defined in inherited classes to provide more information that exist in the actual class definitions of Literal and Empty. Properties of Literal class Literal extends Data { kind: \"Literal\"; status: 200 | 201; hasData: true; hasError: false; noValue: false; data: T; } Properties of Empty class Empty extends NoValue { kind: \"Empty\"; status: 404; hasData: false; hasError: false; noValue: true; } There are (at least) five different ways to evaluate and process values that are returned as Literal or Either instances, with reasons why each may be good for certain situations. We will be using the same data for all of the following examples, which is a basic example of loading a configuration value. Example Literal/Empty for use in following examples import { readFileSync } from \"fs\"; function loadPortConfig(filename: string = \"port.txt\"): Literal | Empty { try { const fileContent = readFileSync(filename, \"utf8\"); const num = parseInt(fileContent, 10); if(num && !isNaN(num)) { return new Literal(num); } return new Empty(); } catch (e) { return new Empty(); } } const portConfig = loadPortConfig(); Every FP object is required to include a kind field, which can determine if the returned config is a Literal. Example using kind var port: number; if(portConfig.kind === \"Literal\") { console.log(`Listening on port ${portConfig.data}, as-per config.`); port = portConfig.data; } else { console.log(\"No configured port. Defaulting to '80'.\"); port = 80; } While kind provides an exact match, every FP also contains three flags providing a more general description of an object: hasData, hasError, noValue. This is overkill when only Either or Literal could be returned, but you could use these flags to filter out errors and empty values: Example filtering by hasError, noValue if(portConfig.hasError) { console.log(\"Error loading port!\"); } else if(portConfig.noValue) { console.log(\"No port specified, will use default.\"); } else { console.log(`Port configured as ${portConfig.data}`); } All FP objects include a status code, intended to represent HTTP response status codes (or process exit codes). One could use these fields similar to the descriptor fields - e.g. responses with status in the range 300 - 500 are likely errors, and this could be compared similar to the last example using hasError - although we don’t see why anyone would prefer this. However, if you are writing general middleware that formats FP objects into HTTP responses, you may find status useful. The above examples used FP properties, but every FP object also includes utility methods. The first example used kind to set a default if Empty was found, however altValue() could avoid the entire if/else block. Example with altValue const port = portConfig.altValue(80); This method is least recommended, but in some environments, instanceof will work to determine the class hierarchy used to create the FP object. if(portConfig instanceof Literal) { console.log(\"Port was configured!\"); } else { console.log(\"No port configured, using defaults.\"); } arrow_back FP Interface Common FP Instances arrow_forward","title":"Data (Either)","component":"fp","version":"2.0.1","name":"data","url":"/fp/2.0.1/data/","titles":[{"text":"Properties","id":"properties"},{"text":"Using Literal/Empty Values","id":"usage"},{"text":"Checking 'kind'","id":"usage-kind"},{"text":"Using Description properties (hasData, etc.)","id":"usage-props"},{"text":"Using status","id":"usage-status"},{"text":"Utility Methods","id":"usage-util"},{"text":"Using instanceof","id":"usage-instanceof"}]},"/fp/2.0.1/fp/":{"text":"All FP types follow an interface defined in the library as an abstract class FP. All FP instances have a property kind, intended as an easily discriminated field to tell one type from another. If you extend an FP instance, you will need to include another property to discriminate between sub-types. This is used for UnexpectedError, which is intended to contain many different error types that developers might like to report as a generic \"500 Server Error\", without revealing details about where the error came from. The various implementations of UnexpectedError all use the kind \"UnexpectedError\", and use a code property to distinguish between implementations. kind is good to narrow instances down to a specific interface, but FP also includes 3 files to provide a general description of items, which also describes how the chaining methods will operate. Objects can be marked \"hasData\", intended to signify \"successful\" responses that include data, including data successfully fetched from the database, or a response for the user marking an operation as completed without errors. Objects can be marked as \"hasError\", intended to signify a \"failure\" is being reported. The final flag is noValue, marking an absence of data without a specific error - similar to the empty case of Maybe (a structure in many functional languages/libraries). This is especially useful for some chaining methods - FP supports two classes of \"fallback\", one that replaces any \"non-successful\" response with the provided value, and one that only replaces a lack of value, but doesn’t change errors. Like Promise methods .then and .catch, FP instances have a set of common methods that allow data to be quickly transformed, and operations to be applied only if data exists. Unlike Promises, Formulaic’s FP library generally does not try to call chaining methods on asynchronous values that have not been resolved yet. In the following example, .catch and .then may be called before the first value resolves. Promise Chaining const response = Promise.resolve(10); const fallback = response.catch(e => -1); const mapped = fallback.then(i => i * 2); However with FP, you should await asynchronous values before calling chaining methods: Awaiting FP values async function getData(): Promise | EntityNotFound> { return new Literal(10); } const value = await getData(); const mapped = await value.chain(async i => Promise.resolve(i + 1)); const second = await mapped.chain(async i => Promise.resolve(i * 2)); FP’s .chain works similar to Promise’s .then - it expects an asynchronous transformation to be provided, does not call the given function if in an error state, and can switch to an error state if the provided transformation produces an error. Performs Transformations const url = new Literal(\"http://example.com/\"); const fetched = await url.chain(async url => { return await fetch(url); }); Doesn’t run unless \"successful data\" const missingUrl = new Empty(); const fetchMissing = await missingUrl.chain(async url => { // This code will never run, because 'Empty' isn't \"successful data\" return new MissingPermission(); }); // => Empty (1) 1 Chaining methods are typed well enough that the transform will be completely ignored if TypeScript knows that there’s no way missingUrl could be a data type. Will keep returned FPs as-is (whether data, error, or another type) const failedFetch = await url.chain(async url => { return new UnexpectedFailure(); }); // => UnexpectedFailure Wraps non-FP results in Literal (to allow chaining) const input = new Literal(10); const formatted = input.chain(async num => { return `Number: ${num}`; }); // => Literal Map works the same as chain() without using Promises. const input = new Literal(10); const output = input.map(i => i * 2); or() and orValue() take a fallback value that replaces any hasError or noValue FP. You can provide an FP instance, or a non-FP value that will be wrapped in Literal. const error = new UnexpectedFailure(); const safe = error.orValue(new Literal(10)); // => Literal const safeCallback = error.or(() => { return new Empty(); }); // => Empty const empty = new Empty(); const withDefault = empty.or(10); // => Literal alt functions similar to or, taking in a fallback value (or a function that returns the fallback value).

The BaseEntityService includes a core set of utilities that can operate on any data.

Assuming your entities have an id field, we highly recommend using the full EntityService. Otherwise, use BaseEntityService. The first parts of this page will be applicable to both EntityService and BaseEntityService, and we will provide a note when using utilities that are only available under EntityService. The EntityService assumes you are in a Nest environment, using a TypeORM Repository, inside a module that looks something like: src/user/user.module.ts import { Module } from \"@nestjs/common\"; import { TypeORMModule } from \"@nestjs/typeorm\"; import { User } from \"./user.entity\"; import { UserService } from \"./user.service\"; @Module({ imports: [ TypeORMModule.forFeature([ User ]), ], providers: [ UserService, ], }) export class UserModule {} EntityService requires entities to have an id field.

EntityService provides you with a number of utilities. To demonstrate a few, we can update the UserService to create a default administrator account if one does not already exist. We’ll first setup the basic structure to lay out the flow: src/user/user.service.ts import { EntityService } from \"@formulaic/entity-service\"; import { Injectable } from \"@nestjs/common\"; import { InjectRepository } from \"@nestjs/typeorm\"; import { Repository } from \"typeorm\"; import { User } from \"./user.entity\"; @Injectable() export class UserService extends EntityService { private readonly admin: Promise | DatabaseException>; public constructor( @InjectRepository(User) private readonly users: Repository, ) { super(\"User\", users); this.admin = this.ensureInitialAdmin(); } /** * Use to ensure there's an initial administrator account * before performing operations that may require an account to exist. * * If the database encountered an error while locating or creating an admin account, * this method will resolve `false`. */ public async hasAdminAccount(): Promise { const admin = await this.admin; return admin.hasData; } } EntityService wraps TypeORM’s findOne method, returning responses structured using FP for easy transformation. src/user/user.service.ts class UserService /* ... */ { public async ensureInitialAdmin() { const existing = await this.findOne({ where: { isAdmin: true, }, }); } } This will produce one of the following responses: Data if a user is found EntityNotFound, User> if the query was not able to find an admin DatabaseException if TypeORM threw an unexpected error, such as if the table hasn’t been created yet. The EntityService comes with a basic wrapper around TypeORM’s save method. src/user/user.service.ts class UserService /* ... */ { public async createUser( username: string, password: string, name?: string, isAdmin: boolean = false, ) { const user = new User(); user.username = username; user.password = password; user.name = name; user.isAdmin = isAdmin; return this.save(user); } } This will return: Data if the user was created DatabaseException if the save unexpectedly fails Going back to ensureInitialAdmin, we can use FP's substituteAsync method to create a user if one does not exist. src/user/user.service.ts class UserService /* ... */ { public async ensureInitialAdmin( name: string = \"Admin\", username: string = \"admin\", password: string = \"admin\", ) { const existing = await this.findOne({ where: { isAdmin: true, }, }); const admin = await existing.substituteAsync(() => this.createUser(username, password, name, true)); return admin; } } FP's substituteAsync will only be used if existing is EntityNotFound - it’ll leave successful data (Data) and errors (DatabaseException) alone. admin will now be one of: Data (either from findOne or createUser) DatabaseException DatabaseException So far all of the operations used did not depend on the structure of the entity, and would work under either EntityService or BaseEntityService.

The FPInterceptor simply intercepts outgoing responses, and uses FP, class-validator, and class-transformer methods under the hood to filter, transform, and format outgoing responses. Formulaic’s FP library defines an standardized object structure that makes it easy and safe to work with data, both at compile time through type statements, and also contains data inside objects that allows for run-time type checking and discrimination of data types. Learn more about FP in the FP module documentation. FP provides great control over data flow, with strongly typed data, even in places where JavaScript/TypeScript throws away type data (Promise rejection, try/catch error statements), and comes with utilities like unless, mapIf, and more that allow easy implementation of default values and error recovery backup flows. Many OpenAPI client generators do not type error responses, likely because rejected Promises and catch statements have no easy way to be strongly typed. FP allows for all data to be transmitted as success data (documented as a union type in OpenAPI), and makes it easy to distinguish success cases from various error causes on the front-end. There are many places where the backend holds data that would be useful for developers, yet presents privacy or security risks to share with the user. FP Interceptor makes use of class-transformer under the hood, configured to strip out any data not explicitly marked as information to send to the client. This enables a number of benefits when using FPInterceptor: Error responses, like DatabaseException, can include the entire exception message and stacktrace to be included in logs, without the user seeing the cause. FPInterceptor uses class-transformer configuration (namely, groups), to transform and conditionally include information in responses.

Enabling \"debug\" will expose a large amount of information, including information that is very usually hidden from users. However, FP exposes a selective set of information that may provide nice insight for developers and users by revealing some information about the system, without explicitly opening security vulnerabilities. This includes things like the general area where an error originates (e.g. \"database\", or \"filesystem\"), and possibly the names of tables. If you are relatively relaxed about security, \"info\" can be semi-safely enabled. However, highly-security-conscious environments may not want to use it. arrow_back Overview Usage arrow_forward","title":"Installation","component":"fp-interceptor","version":"2.0.1","name":"install","url":"/fp-interceptor/2.0.1/install/","titles":[{"text":"NPM Packages","id":"_npm_packages"},{"text":"Add to Nest","id":"_add_to_nest"},{"text":"Configuration","id":"_configuration"},{"text":"Class Transformer Groups","id":"_class_transformer_groups"},{"text":"Set All Groups","id":"_set_all_groups"},{"text":"Provide Additional Groups","id":"_provide_additional_groups"},{"text":"Debug and Info Output","id":"_debug_and_info_output"}]},"/fp-interceptor/2.0.1/usage/":{"text":"With FPInterceptor installed as a Nest interceptor, you can return FP objects in your controllers. import { DatabaseException, oneOfFP } from \"@formulaic/fp\"; import { Controller } from \"@nestjs/common\"; import { ApiExtraModels, ApiTags, ApiOkResponse } from \"@nestjs/swagger\"; import { UserService } from \"./user.service\"; import { UserDetails } from \"./dto/user-response\"; (1) @Controller(\"user\") @ApiTags(\"users\") @ApiExtraModels( (2) MissingPermission, NotFound, UserDetails, DatabaseException ) export class UserController { public constructor( private readonly users: UserService, (3) ) {} @Get(\":userId\") @ApiOkResponse(oneOfFP([ NotFound, UserDetails, DatabaseException, ])) public async userDetails( @Param(\"userId\") userId: string, ): Promise | DatabaseException | UserDetails> { const found = await this.users.findById(userId); (4) const response = await permitted.mapData(async user => { return new UserDetails(user, false); }); return response; } } 1 The custom FP class UserDetails was defined in the FP documentation 2 https://docs.nestjs.com/openapi/introduction does not expose models defined in oneOf constructs, which is what oneOfFP uses, so OpenAPI must be explicitly told to document the models. 3 This example uses the UserService defined in documentation for Formulaic’s entity-service. 4 findById returns either EntityNotFound or Data, as defined by the entity-service - EntityNotFound is a sub-type of NotFound.

Manage Create Browse Update Delete Remove Submit Typically applications use CRUD (create, read, update, delete) actions to represent most operations - we’ve renamed read to browse to make all actions 6 letters long. We also supply both \"delete\" and \"remove\", intended for applications that use soft-deletion. delete is intended to be the user’s primary thought of deletion - soft-delete if the application supports it, otherwise hard deletion. remove is intended to always represent a hard-deletion, which may be an administrator-only action. We find that we’re often in a position where there’s one additional action to add to entities, that’s relatively obvious given what the entity represents. An article draft needs to be published/applied to go live A user-submission in a moderation queue gets approved by a moderator A shopping cart gets converted into an order An action that’s been drafted/dry-run is approved to be executed You may wish to create a unique action for each of these.

Annotate with @Private(), or if you set defaultPolicy: \"deny\", mark routes that do not require authentication with @Public(). Use @RequireRoles() to require users to have all of the roles listed. Alternatively, use RequireOneOfRole to offer a list of roles that users must have one or more of to access the route.
